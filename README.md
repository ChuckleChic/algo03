A brief understanding -
1. Context and Problem Statement:
   - Context: The abstract begins by highlighting the prominence of hash-based data structures and algorithms on the Internet, especially for tasks related to measurement, monitoring, and security.
   - Problem Statement: It acknowledges that existing hash table algorithms, such as Cuckoo Hash, Peacock Hash, Double Hash, Link Hash, and D-left Hash, face issues like high memory usage, extended insertion and query times, and problems like insertion failures requiring rehashing.

2. Proposed Solution:
   - The paper proposes an improvement to the kick-out mechanism of the Cuckoo Hash algorithm.
   - Introduces a new hash table structure named "Odd-Even Hash (OE Hash)" algorithm.

3. Key Features of OE Hash Algorithm:
   - Efficiency: Experimental results suggest that the OE Hash algorithm is more efficient than existing algorithms like Link Hash, Linear Hash, and Cuckoo Hash.
   - Balanced Performance: OE Hash considers both query and insertion times while minimizing space utilization.
   - Elimination of Insertion Failures: It claims to have resolved insertion failures that lead to rehashing, making it suitable for massive data storage.

4. Keywords:
   - Cuckoo hashing, Hash collision, Odd-Even Hash, Rehashing: Important terms and concepts related to the content of the paper.

5. Introduction:
   - Context: The section introduces the growing demand for fast storage, query, and processing of massive data due to the rapid development of the Internet.
   - Example: Highlights the challenges posed by the increasing user data on platforms like Facebook.
   - Importance of Efficient Query Modules: Emphasizes the importance of efficient query modules, particularly in key-value stores widely used in various applications.

6. Conclusion:
